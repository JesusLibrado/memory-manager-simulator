# Memory management simulation

Final exam for Operative Systems course.

## Instructions

Develop a memory manager with dynamic memory allocation simulation. 

Memory must have 256 Kb capacity. Each process must use 2 Kb chunks.

Implement the next algorithms:

* First fit
* Best fit
* Worst fit
* Next fit

## Input

5

0 10 4

3 20 6

5 8 3

9 15 8

12 25 9

The first integer means the number of process to be read.

First number indicates the moment at which this process starts.

Second number indicates the moment at which this process ends.

Last number indicates the number of memory chunks it requires.
